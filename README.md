Title: My Personal Website
My goals was to combine my html and css skills to create a basic webpage that can transition from multiple pages with consistent styling throughout each page to showcase my abilities I have obtained throughout my time in class so far.

v2. In this new version of my page, I did a complete restructuring of my page to reflect the knowledge I've obtained in class as well as applying my problem solving abilities to accomplish requirement goals to create hover effects.

Changes:
-first page combined all elements to create a combined box that uses z-index and flex.
-added a info input at the bottom of home page with a submit button that leads to new successful submission page.
-nav now has hover effects when highlighting what page you would like to go to.
-about page: turned into separate boxes aligned in columns and when hovering over each box, it pops out using hover effects.
-portfolio page: kept content in row format top to bottom but added a little more styling with a hover effect that adds a shadow when hovering over each box.
